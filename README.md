Quick experiment to wrap [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) for use
in R.

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("timelyportfolio/excalidrawr")
```

## Example

Currently, the package does very little except open an `Excalidraw`
instance ready for your creative adventures.

``` r
library(excalidrawr)

excalidraw()
```
